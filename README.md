## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on AI, API, and integration documentation.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more in-depth Python programming and more about data science tools.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Red pandas were given the name 'panda' fifty years before the black and white variety of pandas. Extra fun fact: The word panda is thought to be from the Nepali word 'ponya', which means 'bamboo eater'.
