## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**whitneymeredith/whitneymeredith** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on AI, API, and integration documentation.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more in-depth Python programming and more about data science tools.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Red pandas were given the name 'panda' fifty years before the black and white variety of pandas. Extra fun fact: The word panda is thought to be from the Nepali word 'ponya', which means 'bamboo eater'.

## GitHub stats

These stats are a little out of date. My current work is in a private repo that I can't pull stats from.
